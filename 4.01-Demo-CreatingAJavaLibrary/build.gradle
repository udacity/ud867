/*

Now that our Java joke telling code is really coming along, we should probably
break it out into its own library. That way we can reuse it across projects.
There's a wizard that makes it super easy to add a Java library project, but
we'll first do it by hand.

First we just need to create a Gradle Java project, like we've been doing all
along. We'll root the project at javaJokes. Head over to that build.gradle
file for more info.
