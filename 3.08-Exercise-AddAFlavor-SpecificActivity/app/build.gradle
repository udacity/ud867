/*

Now let's add an entirely new activity to one flavor. We'll make an app where
both flavors present a "Tell Joke" button. In the paid flavor that button will
launch a new activity that displays a joke, while the free flavor will display
a toast telling the user to upgrade to the paid version.

Exercises:

1. Import the project into Android Studio.
2. Build the project and deploy it onto a device (or emulator).
3. Declare free and paid flavors, and replicate MainActivity across the flavors.
4. Build and deploy both flavors of your app to confirm that everything still
   works.
4. Add an activity to the paid flavor that tells a joke. Remember the manifest!
5. Change the action of the button such that it launches your new activity.
6. Build and deploy both flavors of your app to confirm that the new activity
   is only in the paid flavor.
