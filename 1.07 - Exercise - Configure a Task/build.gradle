/*
    In this series of exercises you'll be creating your very first Gradle
    task. Be sure to try and run your task after each exercise to ensure
    that your Gradle build script is properly formatted.

    Exercises:

    1. Create an empty task definition and name your task "hello".
    2. Give your task a description.
    3. Add an action to your task which prints "Hello World!"

    Hint: Take a look at the Gradle DSL Reference if you need help adding
    a description.
