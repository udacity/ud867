/*

In this series of exercises you'll be practicing different ways to pass
properties into your Gradle build. We've again provided a set of sources files
and an archive task for you to modify.

Exercises:

1. Run the "bundleWeb" task and note the error displayed by Gradle.

2. Add the appropriate property to the gradle.properties file so that the
"bundleWeb" task will create a zip file in a folder "build".

3. Run the "bundleWeb" task by passing the value of the "webOutputDir" property
via the command line so that the zip file is created in a folder "build2".

4. Define an extra project property in your build script whose value
determines the name of the zip file created by "bundleWeb" (Continue passing
in the webOuputDir property via the command line).

task bundleWeb(type: Zip) {
    baseName = 'web'
    destinationDir = file(webOutputDir)

    from 'src/web'
}

task clean(type: Delete) {
    delete 'build'
    delete 'build2'
    delete 'build3'
}
