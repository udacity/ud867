/* In this series of exercises you'll be practicing different ways to pass
properties into your Gradle build. We've again provided a set of sources files
and an archive task for you to modify.

Exercises:

1. Run the "bundleWeb" task and note the error displayed by Gradle.

2. Add the appropriate property to the gradle.properties file so that the
"bundleWeb" task will create a zip file in a folder "build".

3. Run the "bundleWeb" task by passing the value of the "webOutputDir" property
via the command line so that the zip file is created in a folder "build2".

4. Define an extra project property in your build script whose value determines
the name of the zip file created by "bundleWeb". */

task bundleWeb(type: Zip) {
    baseName = 'web'
    destinationDir = file(webOutputDir)

    from 'src/web'
}
