// entire build script delegates to 'project' object (everything in build script are properties or methods of 'project') 
// Example: task is a method in 'project' for declaring a task
project.task("myTask1")


// build script delegates to 'project' -> can leave off 'project'
task("myTask2")


// we can leave of parentheses as well
task "myTask3"


// advanced groovy features -> can leave of quotes as well
task myTask4


// we can access properties and methods of groovy objects (example tasks)
myTask4.description = "This is what's shown in the task list"
myTask4.group = "This is the heading for this task in the task list,"


// we can do things like do first or do last
myTask4.doLast {println "Do this last"}
myTask4.doFirst {println "Do this first"}


// or we can all do it inside the task

/*

Two things:
1. 'group' delegates to task -> 'group' is same as 'task.group' 
2. properties of task objects setters with same name

*/
task myTask7 {
    description("Description") // Function call works
    group = "Some group" // Assignment also works
    doLast { 
        println "Here's the action" // We can also omit the parentheses, because Groovy syntax
    }

// some properties can be set the following way:

    doLast {
        println "Doing something"
