    In this series of exercises you'll be developing your knowledge of task
    dependencies. For these exercises we've provided some tasks for you.
    The tasks are all steps required to prepare a cup of coffee. The end
    result is to be able to prepare either a black or sweetened cup of
    coffee.

    Exercises:

    1. Configure dependencies for the "brew", "pour" and "drink" tasks
    such that to drink my coffee I must first pour it, and pouring my
    coffee requires me to first brew it.

    2. Configure dependencies for the "drink" and "addSweetener" tasks
    such that adding sweetener requires that my coffee be poured and if
    I am adding sweetener, I shouldn't drink my coffee until I've done
    so.

    3. Configure dependencies for the "blackCoffee" and "sweetCoffee"
    tasks so that both include drinking coffee, but the "sweetCoffee"
    task also includes the adding of sweetener to my coffee.

    4. Make sure your dependencies are correctly configured by running
    "blackCoffee" and "sweetCoffee" tasks individually using the Gradle
    wrapper.

    Hint: When considering an "optional" build step, such as sweetening
    my coffee, a "dependsOn" relationship isn't quite appropriate. I
    don't always want to add sweetener in my coffee, but IF I do, I
    should do so before I take a drink. Take a look at the Gradle user
    guide for more information.
