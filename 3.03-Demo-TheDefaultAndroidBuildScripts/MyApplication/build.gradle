/*

There's a whole lot going on in the default Android build scripts. For
starters, this is actually a multi-project build, and the Android app itself
is a subproject. We'll talk all about multi project builds in lesson 4, but
It's set up that way so it's easy to add other sub-projects that we want to
build together with the app, like libraries, or even a back-end.

There are two things to note in this build script. First, we declare a
buildscript dependency on 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:1.1.0'. This is
where the Android plugin for Gradle lives.

*/

// Top-level build file where you can add configuration options common to all sub-projects/modules.

buildscript {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:1.1.0'

        // NOTE: Do not place your application dependencies here; they belong
        // in the individual module build.gradle files
    }
}

/*

Second, we'll talk about this part of the Gradle API soon, but this block adds
the jcenter repository to every subproject of the build.

*/

allprojects {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }
}

/*

Let's take a look at the build script specifically for the Android app, which
is in the /app directory.
