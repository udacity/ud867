/*

Let's move our joke telling code from our build script to a Java project, and
build it from Android Studio. We've already written the joke, so all you need
to do is:

1. Apply the Java plugin to your project.
2. Sync the Gradle project model with the Android Studio project model using
   the tool bar icon.
3. Browse through the tasks in the Gradle pane of Android Studio.
4. Use the Gradle "Application" plugin to build and run JokeTeller.

Hint: https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/application_plugin.html

It's difficult to get Android studio to use the solution.gradle file, so to
run our solution, you can either run from the command line with the -b flag,
or uncomment the following line to essentially paste the contents of the
solution file into this one.
