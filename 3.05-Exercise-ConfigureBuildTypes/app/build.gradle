/*

In this series of exercises you'll we working with Android build types. Build
types are a way of creating variants of your application. In this case, we'll
be configuring one of the two default build types created for every Android
project.

Exercises:

1. Import the project into Android Studio.
2. Build the project and deploy it onto a device (or emulator). Note the
   application id shown on the main activity.
3. Set the application id suffix for the 'debug' build type to 'debug.
4. Rebuild your project and deploy it onto your device.
5. Confirm that the application id shown includes the configured suffix.
