It's time for you to create your first Gradle task. Be sure to try and run
your task after each exercise to ensure that your Gradle build script is
properly formatted.

Exercises:

1. Create an empty task definition and name your task "hello".
2. Give your task a description.
3. Add an action to your task which prints "Hello World!"

Hint: Take a look at the Gradle DSL Reference if you need help adding a
description.

Hint: Don't forget about the solution file!
