/*

In this series of exercises we will be working with configurations. We've
provided some source code that requires some additional dependencies in order
to properly compile.

Exercises:

1. Create a new configuration called 'deps'.
2. Make the 'compile' configuration extend from the 'deps' configuration.
3. Add a dependency to the latest version of Google's 'guava' library to
   the 'deps' configuration.
4. Build the project and ensure there are no errors.
5. Add a task called 'zipDeps' that creates a Zip file including all the
   files from the 'deps' configuration. Assign a baseName of 'dependencyArchive'
   and a  classifier of 'deps' to the archive.
6. Run the 'zipDeps' task and confirm it includes the 'guava' JAR.

Hint: Take a look at the Configuration DSL Reference page for how to make
one configuration extend from another.
